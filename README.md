# Heart-Disease-Predication
Machine learning (ML) proves to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare industry .The peopleâ€™s age who are suffering from the disease or not. Here, target = 1 implies that the person is suffering from heart disease and target = 0 implies the person is not suffering. The dataset contains 14 columns and 303 rows.
This makes heart disease a major concern to be dealt with. But it is difficult to identify heart disease because of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate, and many other factors. Due to such constraints, scientists have turned towards modern approaches like Data Mining and Machine Learning for predicting the disease.
This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.
